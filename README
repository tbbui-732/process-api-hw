# OS - Three Easy Pieces
## Process API Homework

Goal: Gain familiarity with process management APIs

## Problem 1

Without explicitly calling _wait()_, the program is no longer deterministic.
Here is the result of calling the program twice.

[wait() and exit() never called]
process-api git:main*
❯ ./main
attempting p1
parent before: 0
parent after: 75
child before: 0
child after: 125

process-api git:main*
❯ ./main
attempting p1
parent before: 0
parent after: 75
child before: 75
child after: 125

Each attempt yields a different result. On the second run, the child was
able to the read the changes made by the parent.

Here is the result of letting the parent wait until the child process is
finished.

[wait() and exit() both called]
process-api git:main*
❯ ./main
attempting p1
child before: 0
child after: 50
parent before: 50
parent after: 125

Running this command multiple of times yields the same result. The parent
process will not execute until the child process finishes, resulting in
consistent outputs.
